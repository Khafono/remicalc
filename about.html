    <h1>About This App</h1>
    <p>
      This project was born out of simple observation — watching Kenya Prisons Service officers tirelessly working with an age-old manual system,  
      performing the same complex calculations day in and day out.  
      I took time to speak with them, to understand their challenges, and to suggest ways the process could be modernized.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took tens of days to fully understand the entire concept, and in the process I distilled it into a <strong>9-Point Gold Standard</strong>  
      — a practical, precise guide to ensure accuracy, consistency, and fairness in sentence computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not resist the challenge to leave a positive mark at Kiambu Main Prison and, hopefully, across the entire Kenya Prisons Service.  
      After navigating through many misconceptions and assumptions… I finally scored it.
    </p>

    <h2>The 9-Point Gold Standard</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>When computing LPD and Remission, treat a month as 30 days and a year as 12 months.</li>
      <li>When computing EPD, especially when borrowing, borrow an actual calendar month from the previous full month.</li>
      <li>For decimals ≥ 0.5, round up. For decimals &lt; 0.5, round down.</li>
      <li>1–30 days → no remission.</li>
      <li>31–44 days → remission is the number of days above 30.</li>
      <li>From 45 days → remission is exactly one third.</li>
      <li>LPD = (Sentence Date + Sentence) − 1 day. (The day of sentencing counts as served.)</li>
      <li>Remission is exactly one third. Get the nearest number with a perfect third; remaining units should be converted down (years → months → days).</li>
      <li>EPD = (LPD − Remission) + 1 day. This guide must be followed without exception.</li>
    </ol>
