    <h1>About This App</h1>
    <p>
      This project was born out of simple observation — watching Kenya Prisons Service officers tirelessly working with an age-old manual system,  
      performing the same complex calculations day in and day out.  
      I took time to speak with them, to understand their challenges, and to suggest ways the process could be modernized.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took tens of days to fully understand the entire concept, and in the process I distilled it into a <strong>9-Point Gold Standard</strong>  
      — a practical, precise guide to ensure accuracy, consistency, and fairness in sentence computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not resist the challenge to leave a positive mark at Kiambu Main Prison and, hopefully, across the entire Kenya Prisons Service.  
      After navigating through many misconceptions and assumptions… I finally scored it.
    </p>

    <h2>The 9-Point Gold Standard</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>1. When computing LPD and Remission, treat a month as 30 days and a year as 12 months.</li>
      <li>2. When computing EPD, especially when borrowing, borrow an actual calendar month from the previous full month.</li>
      <li>3. For decimals ≥ 0.5, round up. For decimals &lt; 0.5, round down.</li>
      <li>4. 1–30 days → no remission.</li>
      <li>5. 31–44 days → remission is the number of days above 30.</li>
      <li>6. From 45 days → remission is exactly one third.</li>
      <li>7. LPD = (Sentence Date + Sentence) − 1 day. (The day of sentencing counts as served.)</li>
      <li>8. Remission is exactly one third. Get the nearest number with a perfect third; remaining units should be converted down (years → months → days).</li>
      <li>9. EPD = (LPD − Remission) + 1 day. This guide must be followed without exception.</li>
	  <li>10. *** Bonus point: Sentence must be handled exactly as the judge or magistrate passed it. 
	  E.g. A sentence of 19 months must not be taken to be 1 year 7 months. A sentence of 1 year 7 months must be treated as 1 year 7 months. 
	  A sentence of 33 days must not be treated as 1 month 3 days. </li>
    </ol>
